# PiPicoLora
Testing the Pico with Lora, INA3221, DS18B20 and OLED display
I wanted to create a remote monitoring node that is solar powered, this works I do intend to add some use of the GPIO to detect and display this has proved to be very 
useful for me in other projects. Using the onboard ADC and GPIO I intend to expand this device. If this is of any use to anyone else thats good There and some snippets 
of code within this that is a conglomeration of other code freely availabe on either Github or the internet
